# This folder contains the nexessary files to run the experiments without training the models yourself. This would result in identical results to the ones obtained by me. 
- Since the checkpoint files are too large I cannot provide them here. If you run the train_one_gpu_medsam_with_evaluation_collab.py following
the instructions given in the python notebook named 'MedSAM_training_file', you should be able to get the same training parameters.
## Pre-Trained Experiment Files  

This folder includes all the necessary files to reproduce the experiments without re-training the models from scratch. Running these files will generate results identical to those reported in this project.  

Since the checkpoint files are too large to host here, they are not included. However, you can recreate them by running the `train_one_gpu_medsam_with_evaluation_collab.py` script, following the steps outlined in the accompanying Jupyter notebook **`MedSAM_training_file.ipynb`**. This will ensure the same training parameters and outcomes.
