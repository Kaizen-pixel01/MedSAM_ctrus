## This folder contains the code for the Wilcoxon analysis and the visualizations made using the results.

### Test Result Analysis
The Result_analysis.ipynb is a Jupyter notebook that contains the steps I took to perform Wilcoxon tests on the results obtained from my experiments. In order to make this file work you need to also download the wilcoxon_compare.py file into the proper directory (if you want to run the same code or you can save it and then change the path in the analysis notebook to match it so that it will work).
